# Homework-Week-5-Financial-Planning

This readme.md file contains information around two financial analysis tools that have been developed to assist the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of one of the largest credit unions.

The tools assist users in enhancing their financial situation and are to be used as a prototype application for demonstration at the next credit union assembly.

More specifically, the intention is to allow users to assess their monthly personal finances, and also be able to forecast a reasonably good retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds.

Through the use of application programming interaces (API's) which are software interaces allowing for the transfer and collection of data, we have developed the following tools.

1) A personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

A key feature of this tool is the ability for data visualisation with the below pie chart being generated for user:

Further an "if conditional" coding has been used which will provide users with feedback on how their savings compares to the expected amounts for an emergency fund, below is an example of the output of this code:

2) A retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years. The Monte Carlo data is then used to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount

Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models. (source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montecarlosimulation.asp)

An example of the output from this tool is shown below:
